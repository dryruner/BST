BST
===

Binary search tree's implementation in C++(mixed with C, originally I use C to implement, but later I use C++ STL(stack) to help implement non-recursive version of PreOrder, InOrder, PostOrder traverse of BST)

## Include the following functionalities
* In-Order traverse of BST, both in recursive and non-recursive version
* Non-recursive version of Pre-Order and Post-Order traverse of BST
* Return the max/min item of BST
* Return the successor/predecessor of a given node(if exists)
* Search the BST according to the given key
* Insert an item in to BST(given key)
* Delete a given node in the BST
